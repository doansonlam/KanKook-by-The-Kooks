					<h1>About Kankook</h1>
					<p>Our project is about a Recipes/Cooking website offers a quick and easy search for any kind of dishes. The site will
						hold a wide array of recipes and dishes for users to explore and try the recipes themselves. Users would either go
						to the Recipes dropdown box then choose one of the recipes or they can input in the search bar that has an as-you-type
						suggestion for quick navigation. Each recipe page will have Ingredients information, Directions, Number of servings,
						Duration, Social Media sharing widgets, Recipe/Ingredient tags, Video tutorial. Users can add/remove any recipes into
						their customizable Recipe lists in their accounts as well as Social Sharing capability.
						<br> We will make the site viewable on various browsers (Chrome, Mozilla) and mobile devices (IOS, Android) using responsive
						site design techniques along with essential Web Development technologies. We chose to make Kankook because it was the
						only suggestion we all agree on due to our past experience in Web Programming. We aim to make Kankook a responsive
						and interactive website that provides detailed results for all users.</p>
